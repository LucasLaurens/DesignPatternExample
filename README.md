## Summary

*More information from* [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/fr/design-patterns/what-is-pattern)

There are three types of design patterns. These three types are used in specific cases, and the latter have several patterns which are themselves used in specific cases, i.e. when a problem arises, a design pattern is there to solve it.

## Types

- Creation
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creation

Creation patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase code flexibility and reusability.

### Structural

Structural patterns guide you in assembling objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping them flexible and efficient.

### Behavioral

Behavioral patterns deal with algorithms and the distribution of responsibilities between objects.
